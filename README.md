# Tic-Tac-Toe
A tic-tac-toe board looks like a large hash symbol (#) with nine slots that can each contain an X, an O, or a blank. To represent the board with a dictionary, you can assign each slot a string-value key.
You can use string values to represent what’s in each slot on the board:
'X', 'O', or ' ' (a space). Thus, you’ll need to store nine strings. You can use a
dictionary of values for this. The string value with the key 'top-R' can represent the top-right corner, the string value with the key 'low-L' can represent
the bottom-left corner, the string value with the key 'mid-M' can represent the
middle, and so on.
